'''
This example demonstrates how to access one parameter from the "data" dictionary
You can also assign a value to a location in the dictionary eg.
data['humidity'] = 50.0
Will overwrite the user-input with a constant value

        print('Conditions are hot, ensure you stay hydrated!')
    
    
    
    # Run the simulation using model, slope, environmental and fuel data
    # Calculates the Fire Behaviour Index, which is then used to choose a Fire Danger Rating
    fire_danger_rating = firedup.calculate_rating(data)
