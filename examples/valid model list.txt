Valid models are as follows

'button grass'
'spinifex grasslands'
'grasslands'
'grassy woodlands'
'mallee-heaths'
'wet eucalypt forests'
'shrublands'
'pine plantations'
'dry eucalypt forests'


Each model weights FBI calculations as follows:
    
'button grass':         1,
'spinifex grasslands':  1.1,
'grasslands':           1.15,
'grassy woodlands':     1.2,
'mallee-heaths':        1.25,
'wet eucalypt forests': 1.3,
'shrublands':           1.4,
'pine plantations':     1.45,
'dry eucalypt forests': 1.5


From these models, we can see 'dry eucalypt forests' are 50% more sensitive to fire danger than 'button grass'
